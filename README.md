## About 

![Portfolio snapshot](https://github.com/simarmannsingh/portfolio/blob/master/images/portfolio.png)

This is a public repository for the online portfolio, which is created using purely HTML and CSS. A future version of this repository in Reactjs is planned.

This portfolio is deployed on gh-pages for two reasons
1. Its free for personal use (important factor when deploying any website)
2. This portfolio doesn't have any backend (yet). A backend is planned but for the Reactjs version.

The portfolio gives a quick overview on my professional projects (dummy or freelance), giving an idea of my professional skills.

Other Github repositories can also be explored which I have not mentioned in this portfolio as this portfolio only mentions recent projects and not old projects.

One can directly visit the portfolio [**here**](https://simarmannsingh.github.io/portfolio/)
